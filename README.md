# React Application

## Overview

This React application demonstrates modern web development practices and technologies, including state management with Redux, API integration, user authentication, and dynamic routing. It provides features for searching and displaying movies, managing user authentication, and a responsive UI.

## Technologies Used

### Redux

- **Purpose**: Manages global application state.
- **Description**: Redux is used to handle complex state management and ensure a predictable state through actions and reducers.
- **Key Libraries**:
  - `redux`: Core library for state management.
  - `react-redux`: React bindings for Redux.

### State Management

- **Purpose**: Manages application state across the app.
- **Description**: State is managed globally using Redux, allowing for consistent and predictable state updates.

### API Integration

- **Purpose**: Connects to external APIs to fetch and manage data.
- **Description**: Integrates with the OMDB API to retrieve movie data based on user queries.
- **Example API Endpoint**:
  - `https://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&s=query&page=page`

### UI Creation

- **Purpose**: Provides a user-friendly and responsive interface.
- **Description**: The UI is built using React components and styled with CSS or styled-components.
- **Key Components**:
  - `SearchBar`: Allows users to enter search queries.
  - `MovieList`: Displays a list of movies with options to bookmark and view details.
  - `Pagination`: Manages navigation through search results.

### Router

- **Purpose**: Manages navigation within the application.
- **Description**: React Router is used to handle routing, allowing users to navigate between different views.
- **Key Features**:
  - `<Routes>` and `<Route>` components for defining routes.

### PrivateRoute

- **Purpose**: Restricts access to certain routes based on authentication status.
- **Description**: Ensures that only authenticated users can access specific routes. Users who are not authenticated are redirected to the login page.
- **Usage**:
  ```jsx
  <PrivateRoute>
    <ProtectedComponent />
  </PrivateRoute>
